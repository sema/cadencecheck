# cadencecheck

Experimental analysis of Cadence (https://github.com/uber/cadence) workflows using the Go client. The analysis checks for unsafe usage of non-deterministic libraries and code constructs within workflows.

This is very much work in progress, and makes no claims of being complete, sound, or useful in any way.
